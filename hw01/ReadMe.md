hw01.py is an Etcher Sketch Program created by Eric Morse.  
It asks user for dimensions of Etcher Sketch board (board is square so it only asks for one).  
It creates a blank board and allows user to move the cursor by typing commands listed below.  
*Don't use quotes when typing in the command during input prompt*.  
*input commands are case insensitive*.  
"up" moves the cursor up.  
"down" moves the cursor down.  
"left" moves the cursor left.  
"right" moves the cursor right.  
"reset" wipes the screen to a blank etcher sketch screen again.  
"stop" quits the program (needed to exit the while loop).  

The program does not use any 3rd party libraries, so no compiler flags or special instructions.  
"python3 hw01.py" will launch the program.
